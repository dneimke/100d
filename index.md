## My 100d Learning Journey

For my 100d journey, I want to focus on modern, front-end web development practices.  

My learning outcomes will include:

* GitHub - ability to contribute, build, and publish code artefacts
* Web Frameworks - I will focus on React and Vue to develop websites
* Tools - webpack, git, and CLI tools
* Azure - Hosting static web apps with a serverless backend and distributing them globally
